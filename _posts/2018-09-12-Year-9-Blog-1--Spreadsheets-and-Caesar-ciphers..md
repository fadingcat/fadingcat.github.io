    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>I had very basic knowledge of spreadsheets that needed improvement.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>To try and understand a Caesar cipher and how to make one.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? 
(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>
    <td>Yes I did, as I had completed the work and worked out a slight extension involving decoding the cipher. </td>

  <tr>
    <td>I mainly learnt by just listening and looking at the board, which was the most important part because I knew nothing prior and was trying something new. I also found some codes that can display things (for example, =CHAR(letter+number). That however, was not as helpful as the codes Mr. Tansley gave us in the lesson, that made it automatic ciphering. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Because I tried with the =CHAR codes, I wasted a bit of time that I could have used listening. This was only a minute or so, but I did end up making a small mistake where I put letters A-Z one layer than they were supposed to go. This did alter my results a bit, but I eventually set it straight and fixed it with a movement of the letters.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will try to focus more and not try anything that isn't being taught, because if I try and fail, I could be wasting time that I should be using trying to do the work, even if I can do it easily and without many stops.  </td>
