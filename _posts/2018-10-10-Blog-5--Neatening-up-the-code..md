(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>

  <tr>
    <td> I just mainly learnt by looking at the board- this was was much more important than last lesson because there were certain layouts and things like how to hide tabs for code and such. However, due to doing not much in the lesson beforehand because of the start of an illness, I was helped by a fellow student in between lessons so I could catch up and get it to work. </td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>One part of my code did not work when I moved it over to a separate tab, when the rest of this did. It meant I had to spend a while trying to figure out how to make it more neat. I eventually had to move the main part over to a different slide and hide all the coding on the first one. </td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will try yo get my code even neater, maybe by laying it out in a larger space instead of in the top left corner, so it looks nicer. This would make some things clearer, but it still leaves lots of unused space, like it does now/</td>
