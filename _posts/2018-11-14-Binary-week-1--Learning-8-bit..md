    <td> Seeing as this was our first lesson of the topic, I mainly just listened to Mr Tansley as I had very limited knowledge of the binary/ 8-bit code. This was a good idea, as we spent the majority of the lesson listening to Mr Tansley explain the 8-bit code to us, which was binary for the numbers following:128,64,32,16,8,4,2,1. If a 1 was put in place of any of these numbers in a code consisting of 1s and 0s, it would signify its number (e.g. 00101100 would mean 32+8+4, or 44 in the binary code.

  <tr>
    <td>Because we spent a lot of time asking questions and listening to Mr Tansley, we did not have as much time to work as we normally would have. This, I cannot change, but I did have a problem with getting the binary code to paste into my google sheets, where I could not copy a certain part, I was only able to copy the entire page, which was the page Mr Tansley had given us to use. This meant that I had to spend time finding a different one and used that.</td>
