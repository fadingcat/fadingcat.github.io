    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>We had 1 week worth of knowledge on binary, and were continuing the code we started last week.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>To almost finish the main code, only with some parts left over</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? 
(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>
    <td>Yes, as all I have to do now is to fix the part with binary incoming, and concatenate that, which should be relatively easy.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I mainly learnt by testing, reading up tutorials online, and although we were working most of the lesson, I also learnt from Mr Tansley. This time we were continuing our binary sheets and we were trying to get as far ahead as possible. I got much further than I did last lesson, and I got the main part of the coding out of the way.

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I did struggle a bit when I had put some code in wrong and I did not realise how to do it correctly until much later on, and I did not read all of the websites that I had used, which unfortunately held the right code to get me to where I needed to be. I found it in the end, but I was behind where I knew I should have been.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I need to read all of the websites, rather than just a small amount of one, so that I can get the full benefit from the tutorials. </td>
