I learnt mainly by just trying and either failing or succeeding. I had done some of it previously in the lesson, so I struggled a bit less and got it working easily. We were extending our shift ciphers from 2 shifts, to anywhere from 1-26, do we could change it easily. I also learnt from what Mr. Tansley taught us and how to do it, although I struggled a bit at some points.

    <td>
 I got stuck at a part where I had made a simple schoolboy error, where I put a code from vlookup in concatenate, and I couldn't figure out what I had done wrong. I eventually figured it out, but that was a bit too late in the lesson and I stayed behind a bit to sort out the problems I had. Another problem I had was the same as last weeks. My hand-eye coordination isnâ€™t the best, and I keep either leaving a letter out or pressing the wrong button completely. This is even going on whilst I am typing up the blog.

Next time I will try to remember which commands go where, to speed me up as I am working, and I still need to improve my hand-eye coordination, which is something I can also do outside of school.</td>
