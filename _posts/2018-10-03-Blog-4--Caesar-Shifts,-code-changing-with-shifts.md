    <td>We had our slightly complicated sheets, and were quite good at coding by now.</td>

    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>The target for this lesson was to make a changing encoded message by altering one box</td>

    <td>Did I reach my target? 
(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>
    <td>I did not complete my target because I was unable to look at any screen for longer than a minute, and I was struggling to concentrate. I however did complete it for homework.</td>

  <tr>
    <td> In this lesson we were looking at how to code a shift cipher so that a change of a number in one box completely changed the encoded answer. The main way I learnt was by looking at the board, although I struggled a bit at looking at it for more than a couple of minutes.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>By the end of the lesson beforehand, I had started to get a migraine headache, which I get every couple of months. This meant that I was unable to look at my screen for more than a couple of minutes, and I was unable to concentrate because my head was hurting at certain points.

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>

    <td>Next time if I have a migraine like that again I will go to matron rather than staying in school for an hour more. </td>
