    <td>To further our learning on google sheets and coding more useful commands.</td>

    <td>Did I reach my target? 
(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>
    <td>Yes, as I was able to complete the main code, and start on the extension, which I eventually gave up on because it was the end of the lesson. </td>

    <td>I mainly learnt by listening and watching the board. As Mr. Tansley was not in the lesson we went into IT1, and were taught the main aims and how to do them by Mr. Keen. I learnt the concatenate command in this lesson,  which adds strings to the end of the 'vlookup' command. I did the work easily, as I knew what I was doing, but by the time I was on to starting the next part with letters translated into binary, and vice versa.

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I had a small amount of trouble in the lesson because I kept spelling the concatenate command incorrectly. I could easily fix this by improving my hand-eye coordination, which has got better over the two year I have been repetitively using my computer, but I still make many spelling mistakes, such as a missing letter or incorrect letter.</td>

    <td>Next time I will try to work faster and look at the keyboard more whilst I type, because even if I can see the text, I don’t know if I’m typing it correctly unless I look down whilst I’m typing.</td>
