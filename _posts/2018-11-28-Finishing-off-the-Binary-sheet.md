    <td>We had a nearly finished Binary sheet, and in our last lesson we were just finishing it off.</td>

    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>To finish my code and have a working sheet.</td>

(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>
    <td>I did finish it, but not in the lesson. The last part I had to finish off at home.</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> Due to us having a cover lesson, I mainly learnt by just trying the different functions and using the ones I thought necessary, which meant that although I got the work done, I did it much slower than I had hoped. I also got a helpful hint from another student which helped me continue further.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I was unable to get a small amount of the code working for the majority of the lesson, which caused my work to stop working for the majority of the lesson, which was a problem. I was also unable to sort out the majority of the decoding, so although I did get it working in the end, in my opinion I was not fulfilling my abilities for this lesson.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I should try to broaden my knowledge of functions, so that I can progress faster and do better in the lessons. I will also try to work faster and look in depth to online answers to the problems with the code so I can not get stuck on the problems.</td>
