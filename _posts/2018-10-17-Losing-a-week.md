Losing a week:

Due to an illness last week, I was absent from last lesson. So far I have been unable to catch up as nobody has yet told me what I had missed, which annoys me as I don't want to be behind. However, unless we started a new code last lesson, my code was pretty much finished and I had neatened it up. I know that some of my peers had gone on to use numbers and symbols in the lesson beforehand, so that might have been what we were doing last week.
